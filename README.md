# About

The School Management System is a web-based application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to streamline school management, class organization, and facilitate communication between students, teachers, and administrators.

## Features

- **User Roles:** The system supports three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role has specific functionalities and access levels.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can add new students and teachers, create classes and subjects, manage user accounts, and oversee system settings.

- **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can easily take attendance for their classes, mark students as present or absent, and generate attendance reports.

- **Performance Assessment:** Teachers can assess students' performance by providing marks and feedback. Students can view their marks and track their progress over time.

- **Data Visualization:** Students can visualize their performance data through interactive charts and tables, helping them understand their academic performance at a glance.

- **Communication:** Users can communicate effortlessly through the system. Teachers can send messages to students and vice versa, promoting effective communication and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, Material UI, Redux
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Yogndrr/MERN-School-Management-System.git
```
Open 2 terminals in separate windows/tabs.

Terminal 1: Setting Up Backend 
```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Create a file called .env in the backend folder.
Inside it write this :

```sh
MONGO_URL = mongodb://127.0.0.1/school
```
Instead of this link write your database link.

Terminal 2: Setting Up Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Now, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. 
The Backend API will be running at `localhost:5000`.

# Error Solution

If you encounter a network error while signing up, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Navigate to the `src > redux > userRelated > userHandle.js` file.

2. Add the following line after the import statements:

```javascript
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

3. Replace all instances of `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` with `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.

**IMPORTANT:** Repeat the same process for all other files with "Handle" in their names.

For example, in the `redux` folder, there are other folders like `userRelated`. In the `teacherRelated` folder, you'll find a file named `teacherHandle`. Similarly, other folders contain files with "Handle" in their names. Make sure to update these files as well.

The issue arises because the `.env` file in the frontend may not work for all users, while it works for me.

Additionally:

- When testing the project, start by signing up rather than logging in as a guest or using regular login if you haven't created an account yet.
  
  To use guest mode, navigate to `LoginPage.js` and provide an email and password from a project already created in the system. This simplifies the login process, and after creating your account, you can use your credentials.

These steps should resolve the network error in the frontend. If the issue persists, feel free to contact me for further assistance.
